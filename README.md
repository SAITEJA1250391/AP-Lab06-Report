#Best Practices & Notes
#Use consistent lighting and a simple background.
#Make sure the camera is enabled and facing your hand clearly.
#Ensure your hand is approximately the same size and distance as during training.

#Future Improvements
#Add more gesture classes (e.g., "stop", "wave")
#Use Edge TPU (Coral) for faster inference
#Improve dataset with more variation and samples
#Quantize model for smaller file size and faster response
